Last night, Damian Beresford from the FeedHenry Engineering team gave a talk at [Node.js Dublin](http://www.nodejsdublin.com/) about our use of Node.js in the Enterprise. The resulting 20+ minute Q&A tells you it went down very well indeed with the audience! Two of the real hot-button topics were Microservices and the Operations approach around this type of platform. Expect to read a lot more here on both of these in the coming weeks.

Here is Damian's deck:
