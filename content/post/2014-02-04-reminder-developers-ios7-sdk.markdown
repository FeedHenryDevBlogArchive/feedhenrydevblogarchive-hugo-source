One of the most popular features in the FeedHenry Platform is our [Cloud Binary Build Service](http://docs.feedhenry.com/v2/app_building_and_submission.html). This enables you to build Hybrid iOS, Android, Windows Phone and Blackberry Apps from within our web-based Studio rather than needing all of the tools on your own machine.

If you are an iOS developer, you are probably aware thatÂ all apps submitted to the App Store after Feburary 1st have to be built with the iOS 7 SDK. Of course, if you are building locally on your own machine you need to update your setup. The big advantage of our Build Service is that you don't have to worry about that and we fully support the iOS7 SDK.

However, in both cases there are two small extra things to be aware of related to the status bar and new icon dimensions. Please check out all of the details [over on our docs site](http://docs.feedhenry.com/v2/ios_7_support.html). If you run into any issues at all, don't hesitate to contact our support department.

Keep an eye out for some very exciting news about our build capabilities in the near future!
