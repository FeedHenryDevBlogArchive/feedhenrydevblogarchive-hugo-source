Like all iOS developers, we’re very excited by the upcoming features in iOS7. However, as with any version upgrade, there can be breaking changes too.

**FeedHenry clients will need to take action on one of these changes before the official launch of iOS7.**

We have identified an issue in device tracking with iOS7 which could potentially impact your Analytics data. Rest assured that we have already deployed a solution. To take advantage of this solution, we are asking that our customers re-build and re-distribute new copies of their Apps to the various App Stores. You can safely do this in advance of the full iOS7 launch to ensure a seamless transition for all of your users. We recommend doing this sooner rather than later to ensure that there is no interruption in analytics data.

Like all iOS developers currently testing iOS7, we are under an NDA – as such, we cannot reveal the specifics of the changes. However, please don’t hesitate to contact [FeedHenry Support](http://support.feedhenry.com) if you have any questions on this.
