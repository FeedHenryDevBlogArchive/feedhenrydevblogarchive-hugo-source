The deployment of v3.9 of the Red Hat Mobile Application Platform will begin for actively updated Grids on March 29th. It may take up to a week for all Grids to be updated.

There may be a period of several minutes during the deployment where your Studio is intermittently unavailable but this should not affect running applications or end-users of apps.

The major new feature of this release is Data Sources for Forms:




    
  * Create custom Data Sources that can connect to any back-end system

    
  * Set the update schedule for the Data Source

    
  * Implement a Data Source as an MBaaS Service in Node.js

    
  * Example Data Sources provided as starting points

    
  * Populate various Form fields from Data Sources including drop-downs and radio-boxes

    
  * Display textual information from Data Sources in Forms

    
  * Non-technical users can make use of Data Sources without coding

    
  * Share Data Sources across Forms and/or provide multiple Data Sources from one MBaaS Service



The release also includes a wide range of bug fixes and enhancements, particularly for Forms.

Further details on this feature will follow here at deployment time.
