The deployment of v3.10 of the Red Hat Mobile Application Platform should beginÂ for actively updated Grids on April 28th. It may take up to a week for all Grids to be updated.

There may be a period of several minutes during the deployment where your Studio is intermittently unavailable but this should not affect running applications or end-users of apps.

The main items of note in this release are:





  * Full Swift 2.0 support in our SDKs and templates


  * First release of the suite of reusable Workforce Management (WFM) Modules


  * Xamarin support updated to latest version


  * Appcelerator support updates to latest version


  * Additional Import/Export features


  * An ongoing focus on bug fixing and enhancements to existing functionality



Further details on this feature will follow here at deployment time.
