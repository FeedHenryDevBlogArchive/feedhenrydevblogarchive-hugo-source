Today [we announced](http://www.feedhenry.com/red-hat-new-teams-and-collaboration-enhancement-feedhenry/) our new Teams & Collaboration feature-set which enables both technical and non-technical teams to work together on complex enterprise mobility projects in both a collaborative and controlled way.

FeedHenry 3 projects often have native Android and iOS teams, a Hybrid team, a web-app team, a Node.js team and Enterprise connector teams before you even consider outsourcers, configuration managers and data processors.

Teams & Collaboration is built on several simple but powerful concepts so that complex teams, organisations and projects such as these can be setup. You get fine-grained control over every component in the platform so that the right people have the right access to the right things and nothing else.

In the video below, I walk through all the details including an end-to-end setup for an example iOS Development team so you can really get a feeling for how powerful this functionality is.
