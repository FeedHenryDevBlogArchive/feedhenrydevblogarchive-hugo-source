Many MBaaS and Mobile Platform solutions provide you with black-box access to your cloud, making them completely inscrutable. You have no insight into or control over what the cloud parts of your applications are doing. Not so with FeedHenry. As an open platform we are always looking for ways to give our customers more management features in every aspect of their deployments.

It's for this reason we know you are going to love our latest release which will be accessible to all our customers from today: Cloud Environments.

Starting at the top level of the Cloud Environments Tab in the Studio, you can see your aggregated values for Apps, Memory, CPU and Storage in both your Development and Production environments for all your Node.js code.

Drilling down into one of the Environments, you can then see Memory, CPU and Disk graphed over time.

Drilling down into memory shows you the detailed App breakdown.

And of course the same is available for CPU and Disk:

The Apps Tab gives you a full list of Apps and their top-level information:

Clicking on an individual App gives you full control over it including Start, Stop, and Undeploy.

And finally, not forgetting the cache.

This is just one part of a suite of functionality we have been releasing recently to make the lives of Developers and Ops people much easier. We'll be announcing even more in the coming weeks.
