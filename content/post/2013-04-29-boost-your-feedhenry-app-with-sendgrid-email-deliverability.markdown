FeedHenry’s cloud-based Mobile Application Platform includes key features for you to develop, integrate, deploy and manage mobile applications.  FeedHenry’s focus is to help enterprises create mobile apps that receive and send data to multiple enterprise backend systems, enabling the enterprise to offer secure mobile data access for their customers, partners and employees.

That important part of our Mobile Application Platform is called mobile Backend-as-a-Service or mBaaS where, with our open architecture and a variety of APIs, we make it possible to have rapid integration, secure connections and management of the apps and endpoints.

Our open architecture based on Node.js, in the cloud-based mBaaS, allows the platform to easily integrate to third party web services. Developers can choose and quickly integrate the best software available to complement the functionality of their mobile app. SendGrid, for example is a cloud-based service that provides comprehensive email infrastructure capabilities to enable developers to add email delivery functionality to their mobile apps without the need to build and maintain an email infrastructure.

SendGrid is a cloud-based SMTP email provider that allows email capabilities without having to maintain email infrastructure (software and hardware). SendGrid relieves development teams of the cost and complexity of managing and monitoring their applications’ underlying transactional email management infrastructures, freeing them to build great applications without worrying about email delivery rates, spam folders, ISP blacklists or scaling to meet high user volume.

At FeedHenry, we constantly receive inquiries about email functionality for iOS and Android apps, and it is quite a task to develop the functionality from scratch, not to mention the infrastructure behind sending and receiving emails.  In many cases, developers settle with just adding a link to access text messaging or letting users leave the app to send or check emails on Gmail, Yahoo! Mail and others. Calling SendGrid APIs is easy, just change your email configuration to point to SendGrid servers and with your SendGrid account credentials you are ready to test and deliver a mobile app with email features. FeedHenry’s cloud-based mBaaS integrated with SendGrid enriches the possibilities for good, secure lightweight apps and superior email deliverability.
