It was a real pleasure to see how well the Red Hat keynote at [Devoxx](http://www.devoxx.be/) went in Antwerp recently.

We don't have a video of that yet, but Markus Eisele [got the band back](http://blog.eisele.net/2014/11/developer-interview-di-8-the-team-behind-the-red-hat-devoxx-keynote-demo.html?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter) together for an encore on Google Hangouts last week.

The guys explain all of the tech behind the demo and show how FeedHenry, [JBoss Fuse](http://www.jboss.org/products/fuse/overview/), [xPaaS on OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/xpaas), and [AeroGear/Unified Push](http://aerogear.org/) worked beautifully together to deliver a fun demo.
