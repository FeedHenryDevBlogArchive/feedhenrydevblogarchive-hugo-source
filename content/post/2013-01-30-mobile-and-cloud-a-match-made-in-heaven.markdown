#### Mobile Apps Dominate yet Challenge the Enterprise


A well-executed mobile app strategy results in improved employee efficiency, reduction in costs and the potential to increase customer engagement and revenue generation.  However, it’s not as simple as it seems. Enterprises face serious challenges, not only in keeping up with the demands to develop new and more complex apps but also in ensuring the security, scaling and management of those apps. Enterprises have turned to Mobile Application Platforms (MAP) as an end to end  solution for the development, deployment, integration and management of these apps.

However to create truly effective apps, organizations need solutions that tie in to their cloud strategy, driving the need for a mobile app platform (MAP) that can deploy server-side code wherever the enterprise needs it, whether that’s a public or private cloud. A successful MAP needs to offer maximum flexibility and ease of deployment to different cloud and PaaS environments.  Then enterprise app developers can create, deploy and manage their apps on a secure and scalable platform without having to worry about cloud configuration, scaling, or lifetime management.


#### Why do Enterprises favor a Mobile Application Platform approach?


As enterprise mobility has matured, organizations are creating a growing number of apps that require integration with cloud, legacy and third party systems. Most importantly these disparate systems must be presented as a unified experience for the end user. Once the apps are shipped the organisation must then deal with  with app management, security and scaling over the lifetime of the app deployment. **Mobile apps have now been elevated from being a tactical marketing tool to being a strategic business initiative that needs to align with the overall business strategy.**

FeedHenry addresses the need for a well integrated mobile and cloud strategy with their Mobile Application Platform. The FeedHenry platform supports an end to end lifecycle model that includes:



	
  * app design and development

	
  * Secure connectivity via HTTPS and/or PKI infrastructure

	
  * Integration with back end systems via our proxy layer and Node.js business logic

	
  * Analytics insight on both client and server


The platform is built on an Open Source stack that includes Phonegap, CloudFoundry, Mongo, Redis and MySQL. For client side development we support  HTML5, Native SDKs and hybrid app development for all major mobile devices and form factors.

Most importantly we believe in a philosophy of “any cloud”. So we can host FeedHenry anywhere you can supply a suite of Linux instances, whether private, public or hybrid.

In FeedHenry you actually can have it your way ![:-)](http://www.feedhenry.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)


**FeedHenry Mobile Application Platform Architecture**


![platform_architect](/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/platform_architect.png)

The hosted **Mobile App Development and Testing** environment allows enterprises develop HTML5 and hybrid apps that can be deployed to multiple devices (iOS, Android, Blackberry, and Windows Phone) and mobile web in a “build once, run everywhere” fashion. But  we don’t have HTML5 religion, Developers are  can use our native SDKs to build apps “the hard way” ![:-)](http://www.feedhenry.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif) .

For Enterprises we offer a Mobile Application Management suite that allows them to distribute apps via a private app store, control access via logins control by corporate Active Directory and/or LDAP access and finally allows external users access via OAuth access such as that used by Google, Twitter, Linkedin and Yahoo. Once a user leaves the organisation we can wipe the data remotely for specific FeedHenry apps without interfering with the rest of the end-users data.

The platform’s **Mobile Application Cloud** meets the critical needs of enterprise mobility. The mobile Backend-as-a-Service (mBaaS) enables full access to cloud services such as storage, security, caching, server-side business logic, and data syncing. Rather than the app on-device connecting directly to backend systems and posing risks to sensitive business data, it does so via the cloud.

The** Mobile Proxy Layer** provides a hosted JavaScript Node.js layer with local caching.  At its simplest this secures internal enterprise end-points, via a mobile proxy layer, avoiding the enterprise end-points being open to the Internet, and improves performance, by caching the results.  However, the server-side can be much more complex if required, for example, transformation of XML into JSON, or other server-side business logic.

A key feature of the FeedHenry platform is the ability to deploy this server-side JavaScript and its associated cache to any Cloud Foundry (CF) PaaS (whether on-premise or elsewhere), opening up an emerging ecosystem of CF PaaS partners such as HP Cloud’s Application PaaS, AppFog, ActiveState’s Stackato, Tier3’s IronFoundry, DELL’s Fast PaaS and VMware, the creator of CF.

This means that any public or private IaaS provider can be used, including VMware’s vSphere, HP Cloud Services, Telefónica Instant Servers, Joyent Cloud, Rackspace Cloud Servers and Apache AWS.  Anywhere you can deploy a set of Cloud Foundry Virtual Machines (VMs) can become the staging target for your server-side code, managed by FeedHenry.

Currently, FeedHenry enables enterprise developers to deploy their server-side code to both public and private cloud and PaaS environments with a single click. The platform is also offered as a cloud service on HP Cloud at [https://hpcs.feedhenry.com/](https://hpcs.feedhenry.com/) and on public Cloud Foundry at [https://mobilecf.feedhenry.com/](https://mobilecf.feedhenry.com/).
