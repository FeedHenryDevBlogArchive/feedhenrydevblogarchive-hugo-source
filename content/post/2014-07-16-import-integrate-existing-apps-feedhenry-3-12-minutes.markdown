FeedHenry 3 offers a range of App importing and on-boarding options including Cordova, Native Android, Native iOS, Native Windows Phone 8, Web Apps, Appcelerator and Xamarin Apps. <!--more-->Our built-in Git support means that you can either manage all of the source code in our Git servers or make use of Gitâ€™s power to push/pull code from your existing Git repositories into/out-of FeedHenry.

Integrating the FeedHenry SDKs into your Apps so that they can make use of the FeedHenry back-end services, including the mBaaS, is extremely easy and the Studio walks you through all of the steps.
