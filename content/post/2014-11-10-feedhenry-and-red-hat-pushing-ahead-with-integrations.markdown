# Overview



It's been only 4 weeks since Red Hat acquired FeedHenry and we are delighted to be able to already announce the immediate availability of the first FeedHenry MBaaS Service for integrating with the Red Hat product suite. AeroGear - Red Hat's open source offering for Unified Push Notification - can now be seamlessly accessed and leveraged as a microservice from the FeedHenry MBaaS Service Catalog. The driver for this integration is the upcoming [Devoxx conference](http://www.devoxx.be/), where we will be showcasing the FeedHenry Mobile application Platform integrating with a range of Red Hat products and service in a fun and interactive demo as part of [Wednesday's Keynote](http://www.devoxx.be/keynotes-2014).



# Aero Gear



The [AeroGear](http://aerogear.org/) project is a one stop solution for all your Push Notification needs - covering Native iOS & Android, Cordova Hybrid as well as Simple Push for Web. It is available to use right now from the [OpenShift Marketplace](https://marketplace.openshift.com/apps/9907#!overview) - so feel free to give it a whirl.

# MBaaS Integration



The new AeroGear MBaaS Integration Services leverages the excellent [Node.js module](https://www.npmjs.org/package/aerogear-sender-client) already developed by the AeroGear team and provides a simple, secure way to integrate Push Notifications into your FeedHenry apps. As you would expect, it uses all the out of the box functionality offered by FeedHenry MBaaS services such as interactive API documentation, wizard based configuration and a fine grained security model. The service itself is quick and painless to set up - simply provide the details of your AeroGear installation and credentials for the AeroGear app you want to use and you are ready to go. Using the service is just as easy - as a standard FeedHenry MBaaS service, you can call it in exactly the same way as you would any other MBaaS service - with a clean, crisp FeedHenry API call.
