If you are a .NET developer, you can now use our .NET SDK to develop native cross-platform cloud-connected apps. It can be used to develop Windows Phone 8+ apps (using Visual Studio) as well as iOS and Android apps (using Xamarin Studio). The SDK is open source and available [here](https://github.com/feedhenry/fh-dotnet-sdk) on GitHub. It can be downloaded via the NuGet .NET package management system [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FH.SDK/).

We have an [introduction](https://ngui-demo.sandbox.feedhenry.com/docs/dev_tools/sdks.html) to the .NET SDK, and all of our SDKs on our docs site. You can then read the [.NET SDK usage guide](https://ngui-demo.sandbox.feedhenry.com/docs/guides/sdk_dotnet.html) and finally dig into the details with our [.NET SDK and Xamarin tutorial](https://ngui-demo.sandbox.feedhenry.com/docs/guides/xamarin_tutorial.html).

Once you've done all the reading, you can get your hands dirty with our [Xamarin Team To-Do Sample App](https://github.com/feedhenry-templates/team-todo-xamarin) which uses the same [Cloud code](https://github.com/feedhenry-templates/team-todo-cloud) as our Team To-Do [Cordova/Backbone App](https://github.com/feedhenry-templates/team-todo-backbone-app).
