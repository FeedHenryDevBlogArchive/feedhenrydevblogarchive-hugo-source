Version 3.5.4 of the Red Hat Mobile Application Platform has been released to all of our public hosted Grids. This is mainly a bug-fix release with one major new feature.




    
  * NEW: Addition of Android API 22 (Android 5.1) to our Build Farms for our AWS Grids. Whilst our Cordova Light Apps and Forms App will default to SDK 19 for the moment, developers on AWS Grids can now specify SDK 22 for their Full Cordova and Native Android Apps in the standard ways.

    
  * NEW: The addition of Android SDK 22 means that Gradle-based Android projects are now supported on those Grids too.

    
  * Variety of bug-fixes, particularly around the Community Edition at [openshift.feedhenry.com](http://openshift.feedhenry.com). Sign-up issues should now be resolved.
